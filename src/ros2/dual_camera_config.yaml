# Launch nodes configuration
#   Here is what containers and nodes will be launched by this
#   configuration file, you can add, change and delete nodes/containers
#   as you want, the 'name' of the node should also be the same in the
#   configuration above.(basic/advanced)
#
#   There are standalone parameters:
#     namespace: the namespace to run BOB
#     rosbridge: True to enable rosbridge frontend connection, False otherwise
#     lifecycle: True to enable lifecycle manager, False otherwise (suggested to leave it True or BOB will not work)
#
#   The Node Containers are executables that will run nodes in the same
#   process, they have the advantage of using intra process communication
#   so no network overhead between nodes, they have the following
#   configuration:
#     name: the name you want to give this container
#     executable: the type of the executable created, we have two:
#                 - 'component_container' is a single threaded container,
#                     should be used when we have simple nodes or nodes
#                     need to be single-threaded (like visual nodes)    
#                 - 'component_container_mt' is a multi-threaded 
#                     container, used for performance and better thread
#                     distribution
#     output: where the output of the messages will go, three available:
#             - 'screen' log only to screen
#             - 'log' log to file
#             - 'both' log to screen and file
#
#   Nodes inside the containers should be libraries in c++, they have the
#   following configuration:
#     package: the package where the node is located (usually directory)
#     plugin: the c++ name of the class with the namespace
#     name: the name you want this node to have
#     remappings: the topics remappings
#
#   Standalone nodes are usually Python nodes that cannot go inside the
#   container or C++ nodes that were compiled as executables, they have 
#   the following configuration:
#     package: the package where the node is located (usually directory)
#     executable: the name usually in entry_points of the setup.py
#     name: the name you want this node to have
#     remappings: the topics remappings
#     output: where the output of the messages will go, three available:
#             - 'screen' log only to screen
#             - 'log' log to file
#             - 'both' log to screen and file
